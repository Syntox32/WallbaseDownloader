WallbaseDownloader
==================

### Beware this no longer works as wallbase.cc ceased to exist
__If you still want awesome wallpapers go to my new project [Haven](https://github.com/Syntox32/Haven)__

WallbaseDownloader is a tool made for the purpose of downloading toplist wallpapers & search results from http://wallbase.cc/.

<strong>NSFW & Collections</strong>: You have you enable user permissions in the settings menu in order to download NSFW rated wallpapers & Collections.
</br><em>Collections are wip, you can only download the first page, usually 32 pictures.</em>

<strong>Download limit</strong>: The downloading cap is for now 500 wallpapers. The program will also add a 1 second delay to downloads requesting over 60 wallpapers, due to stress on the wallbase servers.

<h2>Usage</h2>
  1. Go to http://wallbase.cc/toplist
  2. Choose purity, category, resolution, etc...
  3. Click on the refresh button on the right hand of the page in your browser, you should now see a long URL with a bunch of attributes.

  4. Copy this and paste it in the URL box in the tool
  5. Choose where you want to save the wallpapers and hit 'Download'

<h2>Additional Information</h2>

Hint: 'thpp=x' is how many pictures it's going to show per page. This is how many pictures the tool is going to download.
If you change this to 'thpp=200', you can suddenly download 200. <em>Please see the downloading limit</em>

<blockquote>For this tool to work you need to have <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653">.NET 4.5 installed</a></blockquote>
